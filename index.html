      Today is gonna be the day<br />
      That they're gonna throw it back to you<br />
      By now you should've somehow<br />
      Realized what you gotta do<br />
      I don't believe that anybody<br />
      Feels the way I do about you now<br />
      <br />
      Backbeat the word was on the street<br />
      That the fire in your heart is out<br />
      I'm sure you've heard it all before<br />
      But you never really had a doubt<br />
      I don't believe that anybody<br />
      Feels the way I do about you now<br />
      <br />
      And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br />
      And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br />
      There are many things that I would like to say to you<br />
      But I don't know how<br />
      <br />
      Because maybe<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me<br />
      And after all<br />
      You're my wonderwall<br />
      <br />
      Today was gonna be the day<br />
      But they'll never throw it back to you<br />
      By now you should've somehow<br />
      Realized what you're not to do<br />
      I don't believe that anybody<br />
      Feels the way I do<br />
      About you now<br />
      <br />
      And all the roads that lead you there are winding<br />
      And all the lights that light the way are blinding<br />
      There are many things that I would like to say to you<br />
      But I don't know how<br />
      <br />
      I said maybe<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me<br />
      And after all<br />
      You're my wonderwall<br />
      <br />
      I said maybe<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me<br />
      And after all<br />
      You're my wonderwall<br />
      <br />
      I said maybe<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me<br />
      You're gonna be the one that saves me
